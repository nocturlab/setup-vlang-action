# setup-vlang-action
GitHub Action that allows you to compile V programs without the use of Docker (because it's very slow).

## Usage
You just have to setup your workflow like this:

```yml
# file: .github/workflows/vlang-build-pipeline.yml
name: vlang-build-pipeline

on:
  push:
    paths-ignore:
      - '**.md'

jobs:
  run:
    name: Run
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up VLang version 0.1.24
      uses: nocturlab/setup-vlang-action@1.0.0
      with:
        v-version: 0.1.24
      id: v
    - name: Build repository app
      run: v build .
    - name: Run VLang tests
      run: v test .
```

## Inputs

- `v-version`: V version. Can be either exact version number, or `latest` (by default).
